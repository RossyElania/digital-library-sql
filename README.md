# Digital Library SQL Project

This repository contains SQL scripts for managing a digital library database system.

## Description

The project includes the creation and management of a database designed for a digital library. It covers:

- Database creation and schema setup for Authors, Books, Users, and Loans.
- Initial data population for testing and demonstration.
- Queries for retrieving important information, such as loan statistics, book availability, and user memberships.
- Data manipulation scripts for updating genres, deleting users and related loans, and modifying loan return dates.

## Files

- `DigitalLibrary_DB_Setup_and_Queries.sql`: Contains all DDL, DML, and query statements for the digital library.

## Usage

1. Run the SQL scripts on a Microsoft SQL Server or compatible environment.
2. Modify or extend scripts as needed for additional functionality.

## Future Improvements

- Add stored procedures for common operations.
- Implement views for simplified reporting.
- Integrate with a front-end application for user interaction.
